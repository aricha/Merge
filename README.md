# Merge

A tweak for iOS 5 that merged together conversations from the same contact in Messages. I am open-sourcing it now to give others a chance to look at the code and potentially work on updating it to the latest version of iOS.

**Disclaimer**: I wrote this code as a beginner in 2012 and as such it is *extremely* ugly and monolithic. To anyone trying to understand what in the world this code does, I'm so sorry.

This is an iOSOpenDev project; you'll need to install it to compile this project.
